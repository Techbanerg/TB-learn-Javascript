// While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one
// out of a given set of paths. In such cases, you need to use conditional
// statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right
// actions.
// JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different
// actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the
// if..else statement.

//You can use multiple if...elseâ€¦if statements, as in the previous chapter, to
//perform a multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution,
//especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single variable.
//Starting with JavaScript 1.2, you can use a switch statement which handles
//exactly this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated if...else
//if statements.
//var e = 'Movie';
